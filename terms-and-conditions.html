    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 2, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Thalexa — a platform redefining freelancing for India and the world. These Terms & Conditions are meant to protect both freelancers and clients and govern your use of all services provided under the Thalexa platform. By using our services, you acknowledge and accept these terms in full.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>By registering on Thalexa, you confirm that you are at least 12 years of age and have full authority to accept and be bound by these terms. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information up to date at all times.</p>

    <h2>3. Zero Commission Policy</h2>
    <p>Thalexa is built on a mission of transparency. We do not deduct any commission from freelancers' earnings. However, you understand that this means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All transactions are directly between the client and freelancer with 1 day buffer.</li>
      <li>We do not mediate disputes, handle payments, or provide arbitration services.</li>
      <li>Freelancers are expected to collect security deposits from clients if required according to their membership.</li>
      <li>Clients are advised to clarify terms of delivery before hiring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Registration Fee</h2>
    <p>We charge a nominal, symbolic fee of ₹1 to ensure only serious users join the platform. This helps eliminate spam registrations and improves the quality of the community.</p>

    <h2>5. Platform Usage</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the platform ethically and for lawful purposes only. You must not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Post misleading or false information.</li>
      <li>Engage in harassment, hate speech, or abusive behavior.</li>
      <li>Request or provide services that are illegal or unethical.</li>
      <li>Impersonate other users or misrepresent your identity.</li>
      <li>Exploit vulnerabilities in the system to gain unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Dispute Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Thalexa does not intervene in disputes. Users are advised to create written agreements or contracts when collaborating. We do not refund or reverse payments — all transactions are independent and between the freelancer and the client.</p>

    <h2>7. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal data — including your name, contact number, email address, and educational background. This is strictly used for platform functionality and internal analytics. We do not sell or trade your data with third parties. Please see our <a href="https://www.thalexa.in/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All original content created by freelancers belongs to them unless otherwise agreed with the client. You are not allowed to reproduce, redistribute, or sell work delivered by freelancers unless you have acquired legal rights to do so through agreement or contract.</p>

    <h2>9. Content Ownership</h2>
    <p>Content on the Thalexa platform including logos, brand names, UI/UX, and design elements, are the intellectual property of Thalexa. Any unauthorized use of these materials is strictly prohibited and may lead to legal action.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination of Access</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or delete user accounts that violate our policies, without prior notice. Repeat offenders may be blacklisted from future registration.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to the Platform</h2>
    <p>Thalexa is in constant development. We may update features, terms, or functionality without prior announcement. Continued use of the platform implies agreement with all changes and revisions.</p>

    <h2>12. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>The initial ₹1 fee is non-refundable. As we do not handle project payments, any refund agreements between clients and freelancers are to be settled privately.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of India. Any legal disputes shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.</p>

    <h2>14. Acknowledgement</h2>
    <p>By registering and using Thalexa, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all terms stated here.</p>
